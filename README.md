#Hough Workstation Configurations: OSX
---
This setup will backup your existing configuration files and hook up various text editor configurations,
application mappings, sets of my favorite functions and utilities, and a few other goodies.  Use this setup 
at your own risk, and if you find bugs please let me know in git or ping me on twitter @chrishough.
