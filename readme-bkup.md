### My Configurations
----
Every developer's workstation configuration is highly variable and tailored to their  desires + software stack. I tend to spend a chunk of time each month tuning my machine for maximum efficiency, and this is my guide tracking the updates.

This is how I **G**ROK, **T**RUNK, and **L**IVE**!**

### Assumptions
----

 -->
### Software
----

* [Atom](https://atom.io/): Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the coreâ€”a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.

* [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) + [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh): Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language.

### Rbenv Plugins

* [rbenv-gem-rehash](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-gem-rehash): Never run rbenv rehash again. This rbenv plugin automatically runs rbenv rehash every time you install or uninstall a gem.
* [rbenv-vars](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-vars): This is a plugin for rbenv that lets you set global and project-specific environment variables before spawning Ruby processes.
* [rbenv-binstubs](https://github.com/ianheggie/rbenv-binstubs): This plugin makes rbenv transparently aware of project-specific binstubs created by bundler. This means you don't have to type bundle exec ${command} ever again!
* [rbenv-update](https://github.com/rkh/rbenv-update): This rbenv plugin adds the rbenv update command that updated rbenv and all installed plugins.

### Shell Theme
----
![shell-theme-example](https://github.com/chrishough/my-configurations/raw/master/graphics/shell-screenshots/shell-theme-example.png)

Download the [Base16 iTerm2](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2) colors, and import them under the colors panel in iterm2 preferences. My theme uses ```base16-railscasts.dark``` which can be loaded in the presets.  You will need to set the contrast as shown to have a clearer definition of the font icons.

![shell-theme-iterm-colors-example](https://github.com/chrishough/my-configurations/raw/master/graphics/shell-screenshots/shell-theme-iterm-colors-example.png)

Under the terminal tab, make sure to change the report terminal type to ```xterm-256color``` and your character encoding to ```Unicode (UTF-8)```.

The background image I created can be found [here](https://github.com/chrishough/my-configurations/raw/master/graphics/terminal-background.png).  Once attached as the background you will notice a red box around your shell window.
