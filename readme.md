----
Every engineer's workstation configuration is highly variable and tailored to their desires, habits, and software stack. I love :heart: rebuilding and tinkering with my build by learning from and collaborating with others.  This setup is what I use to get the job done, however, don't just accept my words as gospel, find your own path when setting up your build.  

>I also think it is important to reason from first principles, rather than, by analogy. So the normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy. We're doing this because it's like something else that was done or like what other people are doing. Iterations on a theme. It's kinda mentally easier to reason by analogy rather than from first principles. First principles is kinda a physics way of looking at the world and what that really means is you kinda boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say okay, what are we sure is true? or sure as possible is true? and then reason up from there. That takes a lot more mental energy. - Elon Musk Foundation 20

If you're learning to code, I hope I can save you time :alarm_clock:. I live by using linters and tools that monitor testing coverage.  Whether I am building a project for the enterprise or side project I hope to make some money :moneybag: on, I run these tools in real time.  I believe code quality, testing coverage, and coding styles are critical to the success and longevity of any project.
